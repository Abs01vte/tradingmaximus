This is not financial advice or a reason. per se, to get "Long," or "Short." It's meant to serve as an indicator, such as the MACD, VWAP, or Fibonacci Retracement levels (which the program displays and reacts to).

Any decisions made by the end user are the sole responsibility of the end user themselves. The Proprietor (program creator) recommends utilizing a robust and deep investing strategy of which this indicator/report program might serve a part.

Best of luck.
